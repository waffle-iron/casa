Interested buyers fill out a contact form and their information is sent to you.
You can advertise your property for 30 days or 90 days.
You may revise your item at any time in the advertisement duration.
Advertisement format listings do not result in feedback, because the format aims to generate multiple leads rather than a single high bidder. When this contact information is forwarded to sellers via email, sellers are obliged to treat the potential buyers’ contact information in full compliance with Homes Trading's Privacy Policy. This policy prohibits use of the potential buyers’ information for any purpose other than communicating with the potential buyers about the information and services referenced in the item description, unless expressly permitted to do so. Failure to comply with this policy can result in seller expulsion from the Homes Trading community.

<li>4. Professional Assistance</li>
<p>The purchase and sale of real estate is a complicated matter that is governed by laws, practices and customs that vary significantly from locality to locality.
